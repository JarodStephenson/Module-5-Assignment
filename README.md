# Module-5-Assignment
LIS 4930

The purpose of this assignment was to create a function with the Point class Rectangle. The Point class was used to define the coordinates of a rectangle. The class Rectangle was used to manufacture rectangular objects. The __init__ function was used to place the rectangle at an initial position within the parameters of 'self, posn, w, and h'. The create_rectangle function was used to create a new instance of the rectangle. The str_rectangle function converts a given Rectangle instance into a string of the form (x, y, width, height). The shift_rectangle function was used to change the x and y coordinates of the Rectangle instance. The offset_rectangle function was used to create a new Rectangle instance which is offset from the given instance in the x and the y coordinates by dx and dy. 

The output shows how the dimensions of a rectangle were specified and printed. Then, the dimensions of the rectangle were shifted, and the new rectangle was printed. After this a new Rectangle instance was created which was offset from the previous rectangles.
